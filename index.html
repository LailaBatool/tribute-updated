          Muhammad Ali Jinnah (born Mahomedali Jinnahbhai; 25 December 1876 â€“ 11
          September 1948) was a barrister, politician and the founder of
          Pakistan.[1] Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim
          League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan on 14 August 1947,
          and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until
          his death. He is revered in Pakistan as the Quaid-i-Azam ("Great
          Leader") and Baba-i-Qaum ("Father of the Nation"). His birthday is
          observed as a national holiday in Pakistan.
